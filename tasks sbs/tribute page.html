            what exactly is meditation?
        </h3>
        <p id="text3">
            Meditation is a practice in which an individual uses a technique such as mindfulness,
            or focusing the mind on a particular object, thought, or activity
            to train attention and awareness, and achieve a mentally clear and emotionally calm and stable state.
            Meditation is practiced in numerous religious traditions. The earliest records of meditation (dhyana) are found in the Upanishads of 
            Hindu philosophy, and meditation plays a salient role in the contemplative repertoire of Buddhism and Hinduism.
            Since the 19th century, Asian meditative techniques have spread to other cultures where they have also found application in 
            non-spiritual contexts, such as business and health. meditation is also having many spirutial sides like attaning mokasha, peace, calmness etc

            how to meditate?
        </h3>
        <p id="text4">
            there are many simple steps to do that<br>
            <b><i>1. find a nice place!</i></b><br>
            a quite and calm place is so important for meditation<br>
            <b><i>2. set a time limit</i></b><br>
            we cant do the meditation for so long at start, so start with a lesser time limit like 10 min then 15 min then <br>
            <b><i>3. check your posture</i></b><br>
            the position of your body is so important your spine should be straight and you have to sit on ground if possible, if you are new
            jut take the support of wall<br>
            <b><i>4. check your breathing</i></b><br>
            noe the important part comes, observe your breath take a deep breath now feel that flowing through your wind pipe now feel it
            filling your lungs and noe feel that flowingthough out your body<br>
            <b><i>5. check your thoughts</i></b><br>
            it is so natural that at any given point of time our mind wanders it is impossible for us to keep our mind without even a dingle thought
            even for 1 second, so try to keep it on a single thought and that should be your breathing, no problem even if you cant do it, the 
            only problem comes when you give up so never give up, and try to concentrate on single thought<br>
            <b><i>6. music</i></b><br>
            if you are still unable to do it choose a nice mditation music of your choice and I preffer lord krishna flute music link for
            15 min verson is avalible below<br>

            my experience and how I felt while meditating
        </h3>
        <p id="text5">
            when I start the meditation I feel the flow of cold air getting in and hot air going out and wihle I hold my breath I feel link
            someone are messaging my ribs and lungs massaging from inside and the pain I feel will dissapper after some time, next I feel 
            my back of neck relaxing after that, I will not hear anything even I keep music with a bluetooth neck band, then for some time
            I see total blackness, then I feel temperature of my body is increasing and then I will see a white blinding light then I feel 
            so comfortable, after this I feel my head is floating and weight less and bending only left side, as I do meditation only for 
            15 min at this point of time my alaram goes off and forces me to get up<br>
            after that I feel so relaxed and my will be so relaxed, and a fun fact a 15 min meditation will nearly cove 1 hour of sleep 
            but it will not compensate whole sleep sesssion, meditation will also help to ensure gut health and helps to control emotions
            up to some extent and reduse stress anxity and many mental illness
